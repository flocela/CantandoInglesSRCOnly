## Cantando Inglés

Unfortunately, I've discontinued appsbyflo.com and Cantando Inglés. Cantando Inglés is no longer on the Google Play Store.

## Intro

Cantando Inglés teaches English to Spanish speakers through song. It plays a song while displaying the lyrics in a list. The list scrolls to the music while always showing the current word. The user can pause the song to see a word's Spanish translation and an explanation about the word's context. There are 20 songs that the user can download from w<span>ww.appsbyflo.com.

w<span>ww.appsbyflo.com holds the songs' lyrics and audio files in an AWS bucket.

This repository, CantandoInglesSRCOnly, holds the Android source code files only. It is basically to show my java coding skills.

Manual testing can be found in [manualTesting.pdf](manualTesting.pdf). The project is not fully covered by automatic testing, but ActivityInstrumentation and TestCase testing can be found at [src/androidTest/java/com/eebolf/tests](src/androidTest/java/com/eebolf/tests).
