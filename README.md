## About

Cantando Ingl√©s teaches English to Spanish speakers through song. It plays a song while displaying the lyrics in a list. The list scrolls to the music while always showing the current word. The user can pause the song to see a word's Spanish translation and an explanation about the word's context. There are 20 songs that the user can download from www.appsbyflo.com.

www.appsbyflo.com holds the songs' lyrics and audio files in an AWS bucket.

This repository, CantandoInglesSRCOnly, holds the Android source code files only. It is basically to show my java coding skills. This project has manual testing as can be found in manualTesting.pdf.
