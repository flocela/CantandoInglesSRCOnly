## Cantando Inglés

Unfortunately, I've discontinued Cantando Inglés and it is no longer on the Google Play Store.

## Intro

Cantando Inglés teaches English to Spanish speakers through song. It plays a song while displaying the lyrics in a list. The list scrolls to the music while always showing the current word. The user can pause the song to see a word's Spanish translation and an explanation about the word's context. There are 20 songs that the user can download from www.appsbyflo.com.

www.appsbyflo.com holds the songs' lyrics and audio files in an AWS bucket.

This repository, CantandoInglesSRCOnly, holds the Android source code files only. It is basically to show my java coding skills.

Manual testing can be found in [manualTesting.pdf](manualTesting.pdf). The project is not 100 percent covered by automatic tests, but Android Activity Instrumentation and unit testing can be found at [src/androidTest/java/com/eebolf/tests](src/androidTest/java/com/eebolf/tests).
